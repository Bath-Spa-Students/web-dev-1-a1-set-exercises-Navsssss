    <p>The series focuses on Lucifer Morningstar, a powerful angel who was cast out of Heaven for his rebellion and 
         forced to spend millennia punishing people as the lord of Hell. Bored and unhappy with his life in Hell,
          he abdicates his throne in defiance of his father (God) and moves to Los Angeles, where he runs his own nightclub. 
          When he finds himself involved in a murder investigation, he meets Chloe Decker, a detective with the Los Angeles 
          Police Department who intrigues him as she is the first human to be immune to his charms. After helping the police
           solve the case with his most commonly used power—manipulating humans into revealing their deepest desires to
            him—Lucifer accepts a subsequent invitation to work continuously with Chloe as a police consultant. Throughout
            the series, they encounter countless supernatural beings while solving crimes together and developing their relationship.</p>

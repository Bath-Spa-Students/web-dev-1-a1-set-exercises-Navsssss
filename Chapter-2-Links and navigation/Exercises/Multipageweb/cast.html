<h3>Tom Ellie is Lucifer Morningstar</h3>
<p>In describing his role of Lucifer Morningstar, he offers, "He's a guy who's used to thinking that he knows everything, and everything is doable, and everything is possible. 
    I think what he hasn't counted on is the kind of osmosis of becoming human about stuff, and developing things like feelings and emotions.
     We find the guy that everyone thinks they know, who's on the path to redemption that he thought he never could have. That's who he is to me.
      Normally his response to things is, 'I need to punish someone,' which kind of whets his appetite for solving crimes. His sense of fun is the thing that drives him forward in life."</p>
<h4>Lauren German Is Detective Chloe Decker</h4>
<p>She's the one woman that Lucifer can't seem to woo with his unworldy charms, which gives the detective a strength that he isn't used to dealing with. That intrigue works fine for Lauren German
    Part of Decker's background in Lucifer is that she originally wanted to be an actress and appeared nude in a film that seemingly everyone recognizes her, but ultimately decided to go into police work.
    At the start, Decker finds Lucifer to be "creepy", but as time goes on she starts to recognize that there's something more to him: "She quickly realizes he's perceptive, he's really sharp and really bright.
     He's annoying as hell, but there's something to that. By the end of the pilot I realize he clearly has some skill; some psychic skill and some omniscient thing going on."

<h5>D.B. Woodside Is Amenadiel</h5>
<p>As Amenadiel - who he describes as a very intense "warrior angel" - he serves as Lucifer's main antagonist. "He feels he has one task to do," says Woodside, that task being to get the Devil to return to Hell, "and Lucifer is making that extremely difficult. I don't think he likes being rejected or turned down. He believes that this is something extremely dire, and ultimately he's right. How they go about solving that problem is what's exciting about watching it."

    In their true world, the two characters are brothers, so he feels that there has to be a degree of love there, but the mission from God he's literally on supersedes all of that as Lucifer's presence on Earth has thrown off the natural balance of the universe.</p>
<h6>Lesley-Ann Brandt is Maze</h6>
<p> Maze, she says, is a demon that has followed her boss - who she considers her best friend - to Earth after he's decided to leave Hell in the hopes that they'll be there for a little while and then come back. It quickly becomes obvious, however, that that's not the case. More than anything, she wants to go back to Hell and bring Lucifer with her.

    "I think when she came to Earth, she thought, 'This will be exciting; I'll get to have a little bit of Hell on Earth and play with these little human beings,'" she reflects. "Instead, she's working behind a bar and having as much fun as she can, but she's bored now. Also, watching her boss become less and less like who he is and being affected by humanity is a problem for her. Maze wants to get back to doing what she does best: torturing souls, plain and simple."
    
    Certainly laudable to have goals.</p>

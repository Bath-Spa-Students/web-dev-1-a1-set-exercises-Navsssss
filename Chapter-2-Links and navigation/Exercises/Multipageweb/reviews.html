    <h3>Positive reviews:-</h3>
    <p1>
    Ellis is a good choice as the season’s biggest anti-hero,<br>
         deftly playing sarcasm as well as the occasional pathos.<br>
          As it gets rolling, Lucifer poses some theology-class-worthy<br>
           questions about the nature of redemption, damnation and duty.<br></p1>
    <p2>
    Lucifer is the accessible one mostly because it feels as if we've <br>
    already seen it before. And we have, one way or another; "Lucifer"<br>
    feels a bit as if Syfy's fallen-angel drama "Dominion" mated with<br>
    ABC's "Castle."<br>
    </p2>
    <p3>
    No matter what its failings are though, Lucifer will always be<br>
    the show that gave us an archangel chasing a chicken while the<br>
    Devil laughs in the background and Season 5 is going all-in on<br>
    the parts of the show that make it such an addictive watch.<br>
    </p3>

    <h4>negative reviews:-</h4>
    <p4>
        The show's creators have replaced the original Lucifer with neither <br>
        a counterpoint nor an interesting abstraction. Instead, they've simply<br>
         shaped yet another paean to the perfect dude, who can carry on a lewd,<br>
          open affair with his psychiatrist, play matchmaker with Dancer and her ex,<br>
           and solve every major crime that the LAPD is called in for.<br>
    </p4>
    <p5>
            In the end, Lucifer succumbs to so many clichés of the genre that it could<br>
         easily be mistaken as a (very, very poor) spoof of cop shows than one itself.</p5>
    <p6>
        Lucifer arrives with all of the superficial flash you'd expect from a Len Wiseman-directed pilot.<br>
         But after falling into the Fox "quirky civilian contractor(s) aid law enforcement" rut, <br>
         this new drama doesn't begin to show sparks of interest until at least the fifth episode.<br>
    </p6>

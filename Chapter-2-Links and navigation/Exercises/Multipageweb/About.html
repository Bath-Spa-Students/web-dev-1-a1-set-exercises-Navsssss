      <p>The character of Lucifer Morningstar was, in 1989, created by writer Neil Gaiman as a supporting character of the critically acclaimed DC/Vertigo comic book Sandman, and was largely influenced by the depiction of the character in John Milton's Paradise Lost. In 2000, Lucifer was spun-off into its own self-titled comic written by Mike Carey, which lasted 75 issues and a one-shot that all concluded in 2006.

        "I guess I was attracted to him in the first place, because he represents an extreme - and an extreme that's a long way away from my own personality," Carey explained in 2002. 
        "He's the ultimate solipsist - the guy who'd burn the world down to light his cigarette. He's not cruel, particularly - although he's capable of cruelty - he's just so focused on his own goals and his own needs that nobody else exists for him.
         It's fascinating to see how that plays out, and how he affects the people who cross his path. But increasingly I've been seeing him as a tragic figure. What he wants is freedom, and he can never have it - not in the absolute sense that he wants it.
          There's a divine plan of which he's a part, and he can't get off that particular hook no matter what he does.
         It lends a kind of poignancy to the storylines to know that he's trying to do something that's inherently impossible."</p>
